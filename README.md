# PlexKodiConnect (PKC)
**Combine the best frontend media player Kodi with the best multimedia backend server Plex**

PKC combines the best of Kodi - ultra smooth navigation, beautiful and highly customizable user interfaces and playback of any file under the sun - and the Plex Media Server.

Have a look at [some screenshots](https://github.com/croneter/PlexKodiConnect/wiki/Some-PKC-Screenshots) to see what's possible. 

### UPDATE YOUR PKC REPO TO RECEIVE UPDATES!

Unfortunately, the PKC Kodi repository had to move because it stopped working (thanks https://bintray.com). If you installed PKC before December 15, 2017, you need to [**MANUALLY** update the repo once](https://github.com/croneter/PlexKodiConnect/wiki/Update-PKC-Repository).

### Warning
Use at your own risk! This plugin assumes that you manage all your videos with Plex (and none with Kodi). You might lose data already stored in the Kodi video and music databases as this plugin directly changes them. Don't worry if you want Plex to manage all your media (like you should ;-)). 

Some people argue that PKC is 'hacky' because of the way it directly accesses the Kodi database. See [here for a more thorough discussion](https://github.com/croneter/PlexKodiConnect/wiki/Is-PKC-'hacky'%3F). 

### What does PKC do?
PKC synchronizes your media from your Plex server to the native Kodi database. Hence:
- Use virtually any other Kodi add-on
- Use any Kodi skin, completely customize Kodi's look
- Browse your media at full speed (cached artwork)
- Automatically get additional artwork (more than Plex offers)
- Enjoy Plex features using the Kodi interface

### Download and Installation

Install PKC via the PlexKodiConnect Kodi repository download button just below (do NOT use the standard GitHub download!). See the [github wiki installation manual](https://github.com/croneter/PlexKodiConnect/wiki/Installation) for a detailed guide. Please use the stable version except if you really know what you're doing. Kodi will update PKC automatically. 

| Stable version | Beta version |
|----------------|--------------|
| [![stable version](https://img.shields.io/badge/stable_version-latest-blue.svg?maxAge=60&style=flat) ](https://github.com/croneter/binary_repo/raw/master/stable/repository.plexkodiconnect/repository.plexkodiconnect-1.0.2.zip)  | [![beta version](https://img.shields.io/badge/beta_version-latest-red.svg?maxAge=60&style=flat) ](https://github.com/croneter/binary_repo/raw/master/beta/repository.plexkodiconnectbeta/repository.plexkodiconnectbeta-1.0.2.zip) |

### Additional Artwork
PKC uses additional artwork for free from [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org). Many thanks for lettings us use the API, guys!

### Important Notes

1. If you are using a **low CPU device like a Raspberry Pi or a CuBox**, PKC might be instable or crash during initial sync. Lower the number of threads in the [PKC settings under Sync Options](https://github.com/croneter/PlexKodiConnect/wiki/PKC-settings#sync-options). Don't forget to reboot Kodi after that.
2. **Compatibility**: 
    * PKC is currently not compatible with Kodi's Video Extras plugin. **Deactivate Video Extras** if trailers/movies start randomly playing. 
    * PKC is not (and will never be) compatible with the **MySQL database replacement** in Kodi. In fact, PKC replaces the MySQL functionality because it acts as a "man in the middle" for your entire media library.
    * If **another plugin is not working** like it's supposed to, try to use [PKC direct paths](https://github.com/croneter/PlexKodiConnect/wiki/Direct-Paths-Explained)

### Known Larger Issues

Solutions are unlikely due to the nature of these issues
- A Plex Media Server "bug" leads to frequent and slow syncs, see [here for more info](https://github.com/croneter/PlexKodiConnect/issues/135)
- *Plex Music when using Addon paths instead of Native Direct Paths:* Kodi tries to scan every(!) single Plex song on startup. This leads to errors in the Kodi log file and potentially even crashes. See the [Github issues](https://github.com/croneter/PlexKodiConnect/issues/14) for more details. **Workaround**: use [PKC direct paths](https://github.com/croneter/PlexKodiConnect/wiki/Set-up-Direct-Paths) instead of addon paths.

*Background Sync:*
The Plex Server does not tell anyone of the following changes. Hence PKC cannot detect these changes instantly but will notice them only on full/delta syncs (standard settings is every 60 minutes)
- Toggle the viewstate of an item to (un)watched outside of Kodi


### Issues being worked on

Have a look at the [Github Issues Page](https://github.com/croneter/PlexKodiConnect/issues). Before you open your own issue, please read [How to report a bug](https://github.com/croneter/PlexKodiConnect/wiki/How-to-Report-A-Bug).


### Credits

- PlexKodiConnect shamelessly uses pretty much all the code of "Emby for Kodi" by the awesome Emby team (see https://github.com/MediaBrowser/plugin.video.emby). Thanks for sharing guys!!
- Plex Companion ("PlexBMC Helper") and other stuff were adapted from @Hippojay 's great work (see https://github.com/hippojay).
- The foundation of the Plex API is all iBaa's work (https://github.com/iBaa/PlexConnect).
